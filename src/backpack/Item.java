 *         This class should deal with items. Items can be picked up and equipped. At this stage each Item should simply
 *         have a name and a passive bonus that they can apply when they are equipped (for example +10 health etc). In
 *         future, items should all have a picture, a small description describing what they do and potentially more
 *         complicated effects such consumable items, items which add abilities and quest items.
